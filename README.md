# Caedon's Descent into Madness

**Caedon's Descent into Madness** is a 2.5D horror adventure game developed in Java, featuring a custom-built raycasting engine for pseudo-3D rendering. The game places players in a tense maze environment against a certain malevolent entity.

## Features
- Custom raycasting engine: Simulates a 3D perspective using real-time 2D ray projection techniques, inspired by first person shooters of the early 90's.
- Image-based level parsing: The level is constructed by reading a maze layout from an image file, allowing for efficient design.
- Custom soundtrack: main theme of the game was composed by me.
- Implemented A* pathfinding algorithm, collision detection, and textured walls.
